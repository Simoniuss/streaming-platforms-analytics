This project is the implementation of a website for the exam of Scientific and Large Data Visualization, at the University of Pisa (a.y. 2021/2022). The website contains different data visualization made with [D3js](https://d3js.org/) to analyze and compare different streaming platforms: Netflix, Prime Video and Disney+.

The website is available [here](https://simoniuss.github.io/streaming-platforms-analytics/).

# Data
A list of movies and tv series from each platform for this project was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) ([Netflix](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows), [Prime Video](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/amazon-prime-movies-and-tv-shows), [Disney+](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/disney-movies-and-tv-shows)). Then this list was completed using [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) taking more informations like actors, genre, runtime and ratings from IMDb, RottenTomatoes and Metacritic. Data relating to quarterly revenues and number of subscribers were collected from the respective financial site of each platform ([Netflix](https://ir.netflix.net/financials/quarterly-earnings/default.aspx), [Prime Video](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/quarterly-results/default.aspx), [Disney+](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/investor-relations/#reports)).
